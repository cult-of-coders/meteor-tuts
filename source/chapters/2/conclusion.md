Good job on making it through Chapter 2!

You learned how to integrate the View Layer into Meteor. 
What's next ?
Well, you need to do your homework first, because it will help you form
new neural synapses that will enable you to remember the underlying mechanism and code faster.

The next chapter will show you how all the knowledge from Chapter 1 & Chapter 2 can be used in complex projects:
Healthcare applications, Government applications, Multi-tenant applications, Role-Based Access Control, CRMs, 
which are the usual enterprise type of applications that may require a bigger team to develop,
and a lot of coding. 

We'll understand how to keep it under-control, how to use testing and how
to continuously integrate and of course: how to deploy!

It is going to be awesome!
